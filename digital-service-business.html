                        The first step to starting a business is to create a business plan. A business plan is a written document that outlines your business’ goals, strategies, and financial forecasts. This document is your roadmap to success, and should be thoroughly researched and carefully crafted. When writing your business plan, be sure to include a detailed description of your business, your target market, the products or services you’ll offer, and a comprehensive financial plan.<br><br>Next, you’ll need to decide on the legal structure of your business. The most common types of business entities are sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations, and S corporations. Each type of business entity has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s important to research and understand the implications of each before making a decision.<br></p>
